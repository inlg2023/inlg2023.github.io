**This is preliminary information. More details and a registration link will be available soon.**

### Venue

SIGDIAL-INLG will take place in OREA Hotel Pyramida, Prague (https://www.orea.cz/hotel-pyramida). The hotel is ca. 20 minutes tram ride away from the city center, within walking distance of the Prague Castle (map: https://goo.gl/maps/x8sL2DZEkSX1YBVH7).

Special accommodation rates for conference participants (€104-130) will be available upon registration (until 10 August).

### Conference Format

The conference will be hybrid, but primarily focused on in-person attendance. In-person presentations are strongly encouraged! If in-person attendance is not possible, remote (live only) presentations will be allowed. The registration costs for paper presenters will be the same, regardless of in-person/online attendance. On the other hand, to maximize potential audience, the conference will offer free online access to non-presenters.

SIGDIAL-INLG associated workshops are free to choose their own format – some of them may be hybrid, but some will be in-person only. Please check the websites of the respective workshops for details.
