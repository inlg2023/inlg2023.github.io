## SIGDIAL&INLG Call for Workshops

The 24th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDial 2023) and the 16th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2023) will be held jointly in Prague on September 11-15, 2022. We now welcome the submission of workshop and tutorial proposals, which will take place on September 11 and 12 before the main conference.

We encourage submissions of proposals on any topic of interest to the discourse, dialogue, and natural language generation communities. This program is intended to offer new perspectives and bring together researchers working on related topics. We especially encourage the sessions that would bring together researchers from SIGDial and INLG communities.

Topics of interest include all aspects related to Dialogue, Discourse and Generation including (but not limited to) annotation and resources, evaluation, large language models, adversarial and RL methods, explainable/ethical AI, summarization, interactive/multimodal/situated/incremental systems, data/knowledge/vision-to-text, and applications of dialogue and NLG.

The proposed workshops/tutorials may include a poster session, a panel session, an oral presentation session, a hackathon, a generation/dialogue challenge, or a combination of the above. Workshop organizers will be responsible for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting papers or abstracts. The workshop papers will be published in a separate proceedings. Workshops may, at the discretion of the SIGDial/INLG organizers, be held as parallel sessions.

### Submissions

Workshop and Tutorial proposals should be 2-4 pages containing: title, type (workshop or tutorial), a summary of the topic, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, a list of organizers and sponsors, duration (half-day or full-day), and a requested session format(s): poster/panel/oral/hackathon session, the number of expected attendees. The workshop proposals will be reviewed jointly by the general chair and program co-chairs.
